    <p>
      Chicken tikka masala is usually made with heavy cream, but I like to use
      coconut milk instead; it's subtle sweetness works beautifully with the
      spices in the dish. Serve with steamed rice.

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place chicken in a bowl. Drizzle vegetable oil over chicken; toss to
          coat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whisk together salt, garam masala, cumin, coriander, paprika,
          turmeric, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and cardamom in a small bowl.
          Sprinkle over chicken and turn to coat evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt clarified butter in a large, heavy skillet over high heat. Cook
          chicken thighs in hot butter until browned on all sides, 5 to 10
          minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate. When cool enough to handle, cut
          chicken into bite-sized pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sauce: Place the skillet with chicken drippings over medium-high
          heat. Stir onion into the skillet; sauté until onion softens and turns
          translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook until paste
          caramelizes, about 5 minutes. Stir garlic and ginger into tomato-onion
          mixture; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour crushed tomatoes into the skillet. Bring to a boil while scraping
          the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the skillet with a
          wooden spoon. Pour in coconut milk and chicken broth; bring to a
          simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally,
          until flavors blend and sauce is slightly reduced, about 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir chicken and any accumulated juices into sauce. Add cilantro and
          red pepper flakes; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and
          cook until chicken is cooked through and tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
          Season with salt and black pepper.
        </li>
      </ol>
