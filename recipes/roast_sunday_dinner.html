    <p>
      A roast dinner is a traditional British and Irish meal that is usually
      eaten on a Sunday and is also known as Sunday lunch, Sunday dinner and
      full roast. It typically consists of roasted meat, roast potatoes,
      vegetables and accompaniments such as gravy and Yorkshire puddings. Some
      of the typical meats eaten for a Sunday roast include beef, chicken, pork
      and lamb. Sunday Roasts are served with a range of boiled, steamed and/or
      roasted vegetables which can alter depending on the season and regional
      availability.

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/350F.</li>
        <li>
          Drizzle the oil over the beef and season with the salt and pepper
          transfer to a roasting tin and place in oven (uncovered) for 1 hour
          and 15 minutes (for medium) or 1 hour and 30 minutes (for well done).
          Baste once, halfway through cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prepare the yorkshire pudding mixture. Place the flour in a jug and
          make a well in the centre. Add the eggs and stir together with a
          balloon whisk, bringing the flour into the centre with the eggs
          bit-by-bit. Add in the milk and whisk again until combined. It’s fine
          if it’s a little bit lumpy.
        </li>
        <li>Place the jug in the fridge to chill (for at least 30 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add the lard/duck fat for the roast potatoes to a roasting tin.</li>
        <li>
          Add ½ tsp of beef dripping/lard to 8 holes of a 12-hole metal bun tin
          for the Yorkshire puddings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Peel the potatoes and chop into chunky pieces a little bigger than a
          ping pong ball (approx 2 inches/5cm across). Peel the carrots, chop
          the cauliflower into florets and grate the cheese for the cauliflower
          cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the potatoes in a pan and cover with cold water. Place on the
          hob on a high heat and bring to the boil, then turn down the heat and
          simmer for 8-9 minutes - until softened at the edges.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, place the potato roasting tin in the top of the oven (move
          the beef down) to heat the fat for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drain the potatoes in a colander (save the potato water for the gravy)
          and give them a good shake to really roughen up the edges. Don't worry
          if a few break apart and they look overly fluffy. The more fluffy they
          are, the better they'll absorb the fat and the crispier they'll be.
          Put to one side.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring a pan of water to the boil and place the cauliflower in a steam
          basket over the top. Place a lid on the pan (or you can place the
          cauliflower directly in the boiling water if you don't have a steam
          basket).
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn the water down to a simmer and simmer for 5 minutes until the
          cauliflower is tender but not soggy. Drain the cauliflower.
        </li>
        <li>
          Open the oven and place the drained potatoes in the roasting tin, turn
          them in the fat. Place in oven for 25 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          By now, the beef should be almost ready (and it will need to rest
          while you prepare the rest of the meal). As soon as it’s done, take
          the beef out oven and turn the heat of the oven up to 220C/425F.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the beef to a board, cover with foil and a couple of tea
          towels – this will allow the meat to rest and keep warm for 30-40
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now it’s time to assemble the cauliflower cheese. Pour 2 tbsp of the
          cream in a baking dish and sprinkle on 2 tbsp of the grated cheese.
          Add half of the cauliflower, then top with half of the remaining cream
          and quarter of the remaining cheese. Sprinkle on half of the salt and
          pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Top with the remaining cauliflower, then pour on the remaining cream.
          Sprinkle on the rest of the cheese, salt and pepper. Put to one side.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring a pan of water to the boil for steaming the carrots and broccoli
          (if boiling the veg rather than steaming, add the carrots to the water
          now, whilst it’s cold. Make sure the water covers the carrots with
          about an inch of water to spare, so you can syphon off some of it for
          the gravy).
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn over the roast potatoes in the oven and move to a lower shelf.
          Cook for a further 20-25 minutes, until golden.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the Yorkshire pudding tin to the top of oven. Heat for 5 minutes
          until oil is very hot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Put the carrots in the steam basket and place a lid on. Steam for 20
          minutes
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the Yorkshire pudding mixture from the fridge. Season with the
          salt and pepper and whisk together. Open the oven and pour the
          Yorkshire pudding mixture evenly into the Yorkshire puddings holes
          with the fat in. Place the cauliflower cheese in the top of the oven
          too. Close oven door. Cook the Yorkshire puddings and cauliflower
          cheese for 20 minutes – until golden.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prepare a cornstarch slurry for the gravy by mixing the
          cornflour/cornstarch with the cold water in a small jug.
        </li>
        <li>
          Put broccoli on to steam or boil for 8-10 minutes – until tender.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now it’s time to make the gravy. Place the meat roasting tray on the
          hob (make sure it’s hob proof) and start to heat. Sprinkle on the
          crumbled stock cubes. Add the reserved water from boiling the potatoes
          (approx. 2-3 cups/480ml-720ml) and stir, whilst heating on a high heat
          until bubbling. Scrape up any bits from the pan and mix in. This is
          where the meaty flavour comes from.
        </li>
        <li>
          Top up with more water from the vegetable steam pan (carefully) if
          more gravy is needed. Once bubbling, slowly add the cornstarch slurry,
          a splash at a time, whilst stirring with the whisk, until the gravy is
          the desired consistency. Stir in a little gravy browning if you’d like
          the gravy to be darker. Leave on a very low heat to keep warm.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the meat from the board to a warm serving plate – ready for
          carving at the table. If there are any meat juices on the board, you
          can add these to the gravy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drain the carrots and broccoli. Place in a serving bowl and top with
          butter and a sprinkle of white pepper for the carrots, and butter with
          salt and pepper for the broccoli.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the Yorkshire puddings and roasted potatoes from the oven and
          transfer to serving dishes. Remove cauliflower cheese from the oven.
        </li>
        <li>Carefully pour the gravy into a gravy jug.</li>
        <li>Time to serve!</li>
